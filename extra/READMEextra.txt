README for extra Tcl scripts.

These scripts are not tclpd objects, but regular Tck scripts, created in the context of Pure data.

changeCoords.tcl - Obfuscate patches by placing all objects at the same location. Optionally 
                   lines (by number) can be specified which will be ignored, and remain on their
                    original location.

pdParse.tcl - experimental script to annotate the objects in the patch with their implicit object number.
