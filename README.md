This repository is a clone of the Pd-extended SVN repository at https://sourceforge.net/p/pure-data/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/externals/loaders/tclpd/, created via the https://git.puredata.info/cgit/ SVN-to-GIT repository by IOhannes m zmoelnig.

The main purpose for this fork is to add a more modern build system which allows creating easy distributions for multiple platforms. But some updating of documentation and help-files will also occur.
