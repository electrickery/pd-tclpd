TODO-list for tclpd (most important things first)
=================================================
- binbuf support broken
- unable to patch classes with dir prefixes (e.g. [dir/class]) (crashes pd)
- bitmap's help make pd crash only when opened via context menu Help -> investigate
- slider2.tcl is broken
- add (or check) GOP
- signal externals? (really?)
