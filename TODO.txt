TODO-list for tclpd (most important things first)
=================================================
- bitmap's help make pd crash only when opened via context menu Help -> investigate (fixed?)
- slider2.tcl is broken *
- add (or check) GOP
- signal externals? (really?)
- objects crash while receiving not-implemented messages. Fixed, error -
- gui objects implement a broken properties panel
- Tcl/Tk errors are not shown, but crash Pd.
- The tclpd-console.tcl is retired as a console to Pd functionality is 
  now standard in: File > Message...
- bitmap introduced its own custom command to the patch file: #bitmap setdata 0 1 1 1 0 1;

response to ^D: 
Tcl: object save: failed
tclpd error: key "-sendsymbol" not known in dictionary

context-menu "Properties" not working:
Tcl: object properties: failed
tclpd error: TypeError in method 'gfxstub_new', argument 2 of type 'void *'
(bitmap.tcl also has this issue)
Raised error comes from tcl_wrap.c: SWIGINTERN int _wrap_gfxstub_new(...) {}

With send/receive messages specified, slider movement responds with:
tclpd error: invalid command name "1005.sl-out" (1005 assumed to be $0)
